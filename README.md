# The preprocess and inference code for ccRCC identification with contrast agent-free CT image 
1) the data preprocess code is in 'dataset_preprocess.py'
2) the ccRCC model inference is in 'ccRCC_classifier.py'
'test_non_contrast_ccrcc_image.nii.gz' is the precessed input ccRCC example from non-contrast CT series

Note：The well trained model checkpoint with 3D-ResNet50 as background can be acessed from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BSZx5LwPfSMuIZvJ3Qj6Js73heLqbOkz/view?usp=drive_link
